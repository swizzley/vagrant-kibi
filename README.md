# vagrant-kibi
Vagrant File for Kibi

## Overview

I an image I uploaded. That image was forked from the official puppet-centos7.1 which I think is just a minimum install.
I modified the image in the following ways:
  * Replaced puppet 4 with puppet 3.8
  * Installed git-1.8.3.1-6
  * Disabled selinux

## Provisioning

Provisioning is working only for Demo versions of Kibi

## Todo

  1. Add support for ES Cluster
  2. Add support for kibi source (non-demo version)
